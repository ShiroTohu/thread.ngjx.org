# Parallel Processing Documentation

Documentation for `thread.ParallelProcessing`.



## Why Parallel Processing?

Parallel Processing is used to speed up the data processing of large datasets by splitting workflow into multiple threads.

Traditionally, this is achieved with a for loop.
```py
my_dataset = [] # Large dataset
def my_data_processor(Data_In) -> Data_Out:
  ...

processed_data = []
for data in my_dataset:
  processed_data = my_data_processor(data)

print(processed_data) # Processed data
```

While this is simple and decent enough for a small dataset, this is not ideal for large datasets, especially when runtime matters.
By using `thread.ParallelProcessing` we can split the large dataset into multiple chunks and process each chunk simultaneously.

## How does it work?

Parallel Processing works best by optimizing data processing with large datasets.

What it does:
```py
dataset = [1, 2, 3, ..., 2e10]

# Splits into chunks as evenly as possible
# thread_count = min(max_threads, len(dataset))
# n == len(chunks) == len(thread_count)
chunks = [[1, 2, 3, ...], [50, 51, 52, ...], ...]

# Initialize and run n threads
# each thread handles 1 chunk of data and parses it into the function

# processed data is arranged back in order

# processed data is returned as a list[Data_Out]
```



## Initializing a parallel process

A simple example
```py
def my_data_processor(Data_In) -> Data_Out: ...

# Reccommended way
my_processor = ParallelProcessing(
  function = my_data_processor,
  dataset = [i in range(0, n)]
)

# OR
# Not the reccommended way
my_processor = ParallelProcessing(my_data_processor, [i in range(0, n)])
```

It can be ran by invoking the `start()` method
```py
my_processor.start()
```

<Callout type="info">
  The **threading.ParallelProcessing()** class from python will only be initialized when **start()** is invoked
</Callout>



### Parameters

* function : (DataProcessor, dataset, *args, **kwargs) -> Any | Data_Out
  > This should be a function that takes in a dataset and/or anything and returns Data_Out and/or anything

* dataset : Sequence[Data_In] = ()
  > This should be an interable sequence of arguments parsed to the `DataProcessor` function<br />
  > (e.g. tuple('foo', 'bar'))
  
* *overflow_args : Overflow_In
  > These are arguments parsed to [**thread.Thread**](./threading.md#parameters)

* **overflow_kwargs : Overflow_In
  > These are arguments parsed to [**thread.Thread**](./threading.md#parameters)<br />
  <Callout type="info">
    If `args` is present, then it will automatically be removed from kwargs and joined with `overflow_args`
  </Callout>
  

* **Raises** AssertionError: max_threads is invalid



### Attributes

These are attributes of [`ParallelProcessing`](#importing-the-class) class

* results : List[Data_Out]
  > The result value<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadNotInitializedError`](./exceptions.md#threadNotInitializedError)<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadNotRunningError`](./exceptions.md#threadnotrunningerror)<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadStillRunningError`](./exceptions.md#threadStillRunningError)



### Methods

These are methods of [`ParallelProcessing`](#importing-the-class) class

* start : () -> None
  > Initializes the threads and starts it<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadStillRunningError`](./exceptions.md#threadStillRunningError)

* is_alive : () -> bool
  > Indicates whether the thread is still alive<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadNotInitializedError`](./exceptions.md#threadNotInitializedError)

* get_return_values : () -> Data_Out
  > Halts the current thread execution until the thread completes

* join : () -> JoinTerminatedStatus
  > Halts the current thread execution until a thread completes or exceeds the timeout<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadNotInitializedError`](./exceptions.md#threadNotInitializedError)<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadNotRunningError`](./exceptions.md#threadnotrunningerror)

* kill : (yielding: bool = False, timeout: float = 5) -> bool
  > Schedules the thread to be killed<br />
  > If yielding is True, it halts the current thread execution until the thread is killed or the timeout is exceeded<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadNotInitializedError`](./exceptions.md#threadnotinitializederror)<br />
  > **Raises** [`ThreadNotRunningError`](./exceptions.md#threadnotrunningerror)<br />
  <Callout type="info">
    This only schedules the thread to be killed, and does not immediately kill the thread
  </Callout>
