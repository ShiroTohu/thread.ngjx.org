# CLI Documentation

Commands Line Interface (CLI) Documentation.



## Installation

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+



### Installing

We recommend using a packaging manager like `pip` or `poetry`.

<Tabs items={['pip', 'pipx', 'poetry']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```sh

    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```sh
    pipx install thread-cli
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```sh
    poetry add thread-cli
    # OR
    poetry install thread-cli
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


#### Building From Source
```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/python-thread/thread-cli

# Install the upstream package
pip install -e .
```

#### Development

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/python-thread/thread-cli

# Install poetry
pip install poetry

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```



### Running the CLI

Open your terminal and run:
```sh
thread
```

</Steps>



## Getting started

Try running the help command!
```sh
thread -h/--help
```



## Log levels

Thread CLI uses the [python logging library.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)

|   Name   | Level |
| :-----:  | :---: |
|   NOTSET | 0     |
|    DEBUG | 10    |
|     INFO | 20    |

Coming soon.



### Parallel Processing (thread process ...)

```sh
thread process
```
Invokes the [parallel processing class](parallel-processing.md#importing-the-class)

> **Help Command Output**


> **Example Usage**
```sh
$ thread process 'lambda x: x**2' '[ i for i in range(1000) ]'
=> Writes to "output.json" every number from 0 to 1000 squared.

$ thread process home.Downloads.clean_data:clean ./dataset.csv -t 20
=> The same as:
  from home.Downloads.clean_data import clean
  dataset = open('./dataset.csv', 'r')

  newProcess = ParallelProcess(
    target = clean,
    dataset = dataset,
    max_threads = 20
  )
  newProcess.start()
  dataset.close()

  prints or writes to file the result
```



Now you know how to use the [`Thread CLI`](#cli-documentation)!

[See here](./parallel-processing.md) for how to using the `thread.ParallelProcessing` class!
