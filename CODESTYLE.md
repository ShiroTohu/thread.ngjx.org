## Table of Contents
 - [Code Formatting](asdfdsa)


## Indentation
It is generally recommended that you indent using 2 spaces, instead of 4.


## Commit Message Guidelines
When committing, commit messages are prefixed with a `+` or `-`. Depending on the type of change made 
influences which prefix is used.

 - `+` when something is added.
 - `-` when something is removed.
 - none: when neither is applicable, like merge commits.

Commit messages are also to begin with an uppercase character. Below list some example commit messages.

```
git commit -m "+ Added README.md"
git commit -m "- Removed README.md"
git commit -m "Moved README.md"
```
